## **alphafoldmodel** is a package to parse Alphafold PDB structures and PAE Matrices into interactive Python objects.

### The package contains the following modules:
- `alphafoldmodel.AlphafoldModel`: The main module that contains the `AlphafoldModel` class.
- `alphafoldmodel.ModelPDB`: A module that contains the `ModelPDB` base class as well as accessory classes such as `Atom`,`Residue`, and `Chain` that is used to construct a hierarchical representation of the protein structure.
- `alphafoldmodel.ModelPAE`: A module that contains the `ModelPAE` base class which parses the JSON PAE matrix file.
- `alphafoldmodel.LoadedKDTree`: A module that contains the `LoadedKDTree` wrapper class which provides an interface over the `scipy.spatial.KDTree` class to instead store and return arbitrary objects with coordinate information.
